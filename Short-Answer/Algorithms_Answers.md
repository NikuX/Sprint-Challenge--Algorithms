#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) linear time: loop that need to iterate n times. 


b) O(n log(n)) complexity time: 'for' loop iterate n times and 'while' is iterating lon(n) time as there is a 
   multiplication operation by 2 that cut time every time in half.


c) O(n) linear time: recursive function without other loops inside. It will take n times to reach the base case 

## Exercise II

Best algorithm will be binary search:
find the middle of n_store
compare the middle with f and identify in which half f will be
drop the other half of the n_store
repeat

time complexity: O(log(n))
